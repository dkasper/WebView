WebView

Simple app to see how websites render inside a UIWebView.

Supports both iPhone and iPad.

Allows configuration for a few settings including scalesPageToFit and suppressesIncrementalRendering

Targets iOS 7, could probably work for iOS 6 with a few settings updates.

Requires cocoapods. Run pod install, open WebView.xcworkspace, build and run.
